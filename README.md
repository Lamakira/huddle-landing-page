## My process

  I started with the Header and then attacked the hero section. The most difficult part for me was to reproduce the background with the curved edges from the images that were provided for the challenge. To do this, I :
- Created a parent div to hold all my elements for this section
- I created three other divs which I placed in an absolute position in relation to the parent div
- I named the first div "Bg-section-top" to contain the top part of my background, "Bg-color" which occupies the middle position and has the same colour as the images in the bg-section-top and finally "Bg-section-bottom" to contain the bottom part of my background.

### What I learned

  I've learnt how to manipulate the absolute position so that I can place elements the way I want them. The same goes for using CSS Grid.
